# AngularTesting
CLI made this project super easy to work with!

The startint point of project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Note that your IDE MAY (... or may not) auto-generate the server by simply clicking run (in my case, Webstorm automatically ran this command).

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

NOTE: Check your main typescript file (app.module.ts) to ensure that it has been added as a decleration!!
        - However, Webstorm may auto detect that a certain component is not added and it will prompt you to do so!

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
